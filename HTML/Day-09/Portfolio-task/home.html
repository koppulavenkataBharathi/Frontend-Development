        <h2>About</h2>
        <article>
          I am a dedicated and passionate software engineer with over a decade
          of experience specializing in front-end development. Throughout my
          career, I have developed a strong proficiency in HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React, consistently delivering high-quality,
          user-friendly web applications. My technical expertise is complemented
          by my experience as a front-end development trainer, where I have
          successfully mentored and guided aspiring developers. I am now eagerly
          seeking new opportunities to leverage my skills and contribute to
          innovative projects within a dynamic team. My approach to software
          development blends technical precision with creative problem-solving,
          ensuring that the solutions I build are not only functional but also
          visually compelling. I am excited to bring my expertise, enthusiasm,
          and collaborative spirit to a forward-thinking organization where I
          can continue to grow and make a meaningful impact.
